## 🧩 Overview

The EIC Case Study Analysis dashboard focuses on answering critical business questions, including:
- **Who is buying our policies?**  
  Identifies which vehicle categories contribute most to policy counts (e.g., Motor-cycles, Trucks, Pick-ups).
- **Who claims the most?**  
  Visualizes the distribution of claim amounts by usage type, highlighting significant contributors such as Agricultural Any Farm and Car Hires.
- **Premium vs Claims (averages):**  
  A scatter plot comparing average premium values with average claim amounts to analyze profitability across segments.
- **Profitability over time:**  
  A heatmap to observe profitable and underperforming segments across years, revealing trends and opportunities.
- **Claims by demographic:**  
  Highlights claim patterns based on policyholder sex, showing which group files more claims per policy.
